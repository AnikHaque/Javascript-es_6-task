<p>Create a JavaScript class named Person with a constructor that takes two parameters: name and age. The class should have a method named introduce that logs a greeting message including the person's name and age.


 


Next, create a subclass of Person named Student. The Student class should have an additional property named major and an overridden introduce method. The overridden introduce method should log a message that includes the person's name, age, and major.


Example:


const person1 = new Person("John", 30);


person1.introduce(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old."






const student1 = new Student("Alice", 20, "Computer Science");


student1.introduce(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 20 years old. I am majoring in Computer Science."</p>
